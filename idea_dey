problem that needed to be fix (solve):
When using one function, the data is altered,
but when using another function,
it reverts the data to its unaltered version.


ideas for the dashboard:

- Create a new page for Analytic
- Make sure data used is from the Data cleaning page
- Total amount of wet food = (seller sku or variation) * price = RM4.90
- Total revenue = total_price - discounted
- Repeated customer =  if customer name in list > 1  meaning they are repeated customer
- Repeated customer name


Important things to do:
- add keywords so user can delete select keywords instead of typing manually to delete row


For Dashboard
# date of purchase and quantity
# general time customer beli barang , brape haribulan bnyk customer based on tarikh

#total customer
#total pumpkin chicken sold
#total Salmon oil and cocnut oil sold
